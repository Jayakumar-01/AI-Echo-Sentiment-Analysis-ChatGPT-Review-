MODEL PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS – SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

1. Overall Model Accuracy  
The model achieved a good accuracy score, which means it can correctly classify most user reviews into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories. This indicates that the sentiment prediction system is reliable for real-world feedback analysis.

2. Precision, Recall and F1-Score  
- Precision shows how many of the predicted sentiments were actually correct.  
- Recall shows how many of the actual sentiments were successfully identified by the model.  
- F1-Score balances both precision and recall and gives a strong overall performance measure.  

High F1-scores across sentiment classes indicate the model is stable and consistent in its predictions.

3. Confusion Matrix Interpretation  
The confusion matrix helps identify:
- How many reviews were correctly classified  
- Where misclassifications occurred (e.g., Neutral predicted as Positive)

Most predictions fall along the diagonal, meaning correct classifications dominate.

4. Model Strengths  
- Successfully handles three-class sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- Combines NLP + Machine Learning
- Uses TF-IDF which captures important keywords
- Works well for short and long reviews

5. Model Limitations  
- Performance depends on dataset size and balance
- Rare expressions or sarcasm may still confuse the model
- Accuracy can improve with more training data

6. Business Impact  
This sentiment model helps:
- Identify unhappy users quickly  
- Track satisfaction trends over time  
- Improve product features based on feedback  
- Prioritize customer support  

7. Final Conclusion  
The sentiment analysis model is accurate, interpretable, and suitable for deployment in real-world applications such as review analysis dashboards, automated feedback systems, and customer experience monitoring.
